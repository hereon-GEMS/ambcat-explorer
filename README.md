# AMBCAT Explorer

**AMBCAT Explorer** is the visualization component of the AMBCAT project, focused on high-resolution digital scans of amber fossils.

Amber fossils provide a unique window into ancient ecosystems, offering insights into extinct organisms through remarkable preservation of both external and internal structures. Fossilised specimens are preserved 3-dimensionally, allowing detailed studies of surface features like hairs, scales, and flower structures, as well as rare preservation of internal soft tissues.

AMBCAT aims to centralize and make accessible over 1,500 amber fossil scans to foster collaboration among researchers and advance scientific research globally.

## Goals
- Enable interdisciplinary research using fossil data for climate, ecosystem, biodiversity, evolutionary, and phylogenetic studies.
- Promote public engagement by making paleoscience accessible through exhibitions, educational content, and media.
- Strengthen international collaboration to avoid duplicate scanning and optimize fossil sample usage.
