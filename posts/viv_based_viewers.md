**Viv** is a JavaScript component designed to visualize **Zarr** and **OME-TIFF** formats. It was developed by the **[Harvard Medical School - Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/viv)** and is available as an open-source project on GitHub. More details about the project can be found in the publication: [Visualization of Large-Scale Biomedical Imaging Data with Viv](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01482-7).

In addition to Viv, the team also maintains two other related projects:

- **[Avivator](https://avivator.gehlenborglab.org/)**: A component within the Viv monorepo.
- **[Vizarr](https://hms-dbmi.github.io/vizarr/?source=https://minio-dev.openmicroscopy.org/idr/v0.3/idr0062-blin-nuclearsegmentation/6001240.zarr)**: A standalone viewer for Zarr and OME-TIFF data. [Github repo](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vizarr)

**Ambivator viewer** is based on **Avivator**.
