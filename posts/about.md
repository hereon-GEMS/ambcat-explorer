## 🎯 Project Goals

- 📦 Centralize and archive amber fossil scans
- 🔬 Enable global scientific collaboration
- 🌍 Promote open access and public education
- 🧠 Avoid redundant scanning through shared data

## 🧪 Scientific Domains

Earth sciences, Life sciences, Photon/neutron-based imaging

## 👥 Project Partners

Hereon, DESY, LIB, ZFMK, MfN, OUMNH, CSIC, SMF, FSU, LMU — and more.

## 🚧 Challenges

Fossils are sometimes obscured by opaque amber. Imaging efforts are scattered, causing duplication and wasted resources.

## 🚀 The AMBCAT Platform

- 🗂 Metadata-rich catalogue of fossil scans
- 🖼 Access to μCT 3D image data
- 🌐 Browser-based visualization tools

## 🌍 Impact

AMBCAT enables interdisciplinary fossil research and connects science with public outreach through exhibitions, education, and open data.
